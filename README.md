# Time

MSSA project

My idea for a web application would allow users to quickly view how much free-time is available to them.

This user can enter the amount of time they do various activities. The app will subtract that from the total hours.

There is a section where you can add time for activities such as:

-Sleeping

-School

-Work

The application will take this data and calculate how much free-time is available. 
The information will be provided to the viewer in an easy-to-read format. 
The user will be able to make better informed decisions on how to utilize their time.
